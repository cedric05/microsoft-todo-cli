Hackathon 2022

The command-line interface, for some, is the natural way to work on a computer.  The "To Do" app is the standard, simple interface to a simple problem.  Microsoft has a wonderful desktop/GUI application for doing such things - https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/.  **tdi** (short for To Do Interface) intends to create a CLI app and interface to Microsoft Graph, the store for Microsoft To Do's managed tasks.  The app will be built in and released through Github - hoping for Windows, macOS and Linux builds.
